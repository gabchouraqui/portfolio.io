# R Projects Showcase

Welcome to the R Projects Showcase in my portfolio! 

Here, you'll find a curated selection of projects developed using the R programming language. Each project reflects my dedication to leveraging R's capabilities for data analysis, visualization, and statistical modeling. Dive into these projects to witness the power of R in action!

## Projects

### (A). Spaceship Titanic Predictions

- **Description**: This was a Kaggle competition to predict some outputs of a dataset of people being Transported or Not Transported. As a team, we did a deep analysis and we've created different predictive models that led to a result of 81% accurate to the actual results.

- **Features**:
  - Data cleaning and preprocessing
  - Predictive modeling
  - Forecasting using advanced statistical models

### (B). Price Diamond Predictions

- **Description**: In this project, I used web scrapping from the website [Diamonds Direct](https://diamondsdirect.com/) and create a model that predict the price of a diamond based on different factors.
  
- **Features**:
  - Text mining techniques
  - Web Scraping
  - Predictive modeling
